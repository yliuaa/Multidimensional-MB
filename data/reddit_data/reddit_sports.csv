Bears - Odunze 
Jets - Fuaga",1710523204,t3_1bfg8q8,top_level
17818,kv0oztv,I just don't see how the Cardinals pass on MHJ to trade back. Hollywood and Rondale are both gone so they need a WR so bad. 11 seems like the closest they could go. The top 3 WRs could all be gone by then.,1710523221,t3_1bfg8q8,top_level
